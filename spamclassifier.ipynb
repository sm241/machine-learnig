# Setup

First, let's import a few common modules, ensure MatplotLib plots figures inline and prepare a function to save the figures. We also check that Python 3.5 or later is installed (although Python 2.x may work, it is deprecated so we strongly recommend you use Python 3 instead), as well as Scikit-Learn ≥0.20.

# Python ≥3.5 is required
import sys
assert sys.version_info >= (3, 5)

# Scikit-Learn ≥0.20 is required
import sklearn
assert sklearn.__version__ >= "0.20"

# Common imports
import numpy as np
import os

# to make this notebook's output stable across runs
np.random.seed(42)

# To plot pretty figures
%matplotlib inline
import matplotlib as mpl
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
mpl.rc('axes', labelsize=14)
mpl.rc('xtick', labelsize=12)
mpl.rc('ytick', labelsize=12)

# Where to save the figures
PROJECT_ROOT_DIR = "."
CHAPTER_ID = "classification"
IMAGES_PATH = os.path.join(PROJECT_ROOT_DIR, "images", CHAPTER_ID)
os.makedirs(IMAGES_PATH, exist_ok=True)

def save_fig(fig_id, tight_layout=True, fig_extension="png", resolution=300):
    path = os.path.join(IMAGES_PATH, fig_id + "." + fig_extension)
    print("Saving figure", fig_id)
    if tight_layout:
        plt.tight_layout()
    plt.savefig(path, format=fig_extension, dpi=resolution)
## 4. Spam classifier

First, let's fetch the data:

import os
import tarfile
import urllib.request

DOWNLOAD_ROOT = "http://spamassassin.apache.org/old/publiccorpus/"
HAM_URL = DOWNLOAD_ROOT + "20030228_easy_ham.tar.bz2"
SPAM_URL = DOWNLOAD_ROOT + "20030228_spam.tar.bz2"
SPAM_PATH = os.path.join("datasets", "spam")

def fetch_spam_data(ham_url=HAM_URL, spam_url=SPAM_URL, spam_path=SPAM_PATH):
    if not os.path.isdir(spam_path):
        os.makedirs(spam_path)
    for filename, url in (("ham.tar.bz2", ham_url), ("spam.tar.bz2", spam_url)):
        path = os.path.join(spam_path, filename)
        if not os.path.isfile(path):
            urllib.request.urlretrieve(url, path)
        tar_bz2_file = tarfile.open(path)
        tar_bz2_file.extractall(path=spam_path)
        tar_bz2_file.close()

fetch_spam_data()

Next, let's load all the emails:

HAM_DIR = os.path.join(SPAM_PATH, "easy_ham")
SPAM_DIR = os.path.join(SPAM_PATH, "spam")
ham_filenames = [name for name in sorted(os.listdir(HAM_DIR)) if len(name) > 20]
spam_filenames = [name for name in sorted(os.listdir(SPAM_DIR)) if len(name) > 20]

len(ham_filenames)

len(spam_filenames)

We can use Python's `email` module to parse these emails (this handles headers, encoding, and so on):

import email
import email.policy

def load_email(is_spam, filename, spam_path=SPAM_PATH):
    directory = "spam" if is_spam else "easy_ham"
    with open(os.path.join(spam_path, directory, filename), "rb") as f:
        return email.parser.BytesParser(policy=email.policy.default).parse(f)

ham_emails = [load_email(is_spam=False, filename=name) for name in ham_filenames]
spam_emails = [load_email(is_spam=True, filename=name) for name in spam_filenames]

Let's look at one example of ham and one example of spam, to get a feel of what the data looks like:

print(ham_emails[1].get_content().strip())

print(spam_emails[6].get_content().strip())

Some emails are actually multipart, with images and attachments (which can have their own attachments). Let's look at the various types of structures we have:

def get_email_structure(email):
    if isinstance(email, str):
        return email
    payload = email.get_payload()
    if isinstance(payload, list):
        return "multipart({})".format(", ".join([
            get_email_structure(sub_email)
            for sub_email in payload
        ]))
    else:
        return email.get_content_type()

from collections import Counter

def structures_counter(emails):
    structures = Counter()
    for email in emails:
        structure = get_email_structure(email)
        structures[structure] += 1
    return structures

structures_counter(ham_emails).most_common()

structures_counter(spam_emails).most_common()

It seems that the ham emails are more often plain text, while spam has quite a lot of HTML. Moreover, quite a few ham emails are signed using PGP, while no spam is. In short, it seems that the email structure is useful information to have.

Now let's take a look at the email headers:

for header, value in spam_emails[0].items():
    print(header,":",value)

There's probably a lot of useful information in there, such as the sender's email address (12a1mailbot1@web.de looks fishy), but we will just focus on the `Subject` header:

spam_emails[0]["Subject"]

Okay, before we learn too much about the data, let's not forget to split it into a training set and a test set:

import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X = np.array(ham_emails + spam_emails, dtype=object)
y = np.array([0] * len(ham_emails) + [1] * len(spam_emails))

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

Okay, let's start writing the preprocessing functions. First, we will need a function to convert HTML to plain text. Arguably the best way to do this would be to use the great [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) library, but I would like to avoid adding another dependency to this project, so let's hack a quick & dirty solution using regular expressions (at the risk of [un̨ho͞ly radiańcé destro҉ying all enli̍̈́̂̈́ghtenment](https://stackoverflow.com/a/1732454/38626)). The following function first drops the `<head>` section, then converts all `<a>` tags to the word HYPERLINK, then it gets rid of all HTML tags, leaving only the plain text. For readability, it also replaces multiple newlines with single newlines, and finally it unescapes html entities (such as `&gt;` or `&nbsp;`):

import re
from html import unescape

def html_to_plain_text(html):
    text = re.sub('<head.*?>.*?</head>', '', html, flags=re.M | re.S | re.I)
    text = re.sub('<a\s.*?>', ' HYPERLINK ', text, flags=re.M | re.S | re.I)
    text = re.sub('<.*?>', '', text, flags=re.M | re.S)
    text = re.sub(r'(\s*\n)+', '\n', text, flags=re.M | re.S)
    return unescape(text)

Let's see if it works. This is HTML spam:

html_spam_emails = [email for email in X_train[y_train==1]
                    if get_email_structure(email) == "text/html"]
sample_html_spam = html_spam_emails[7]
print(sample_html_spam.get_content().strip()[:1000], "...")

And this is the resulting plain text:

print(html_to_plain_text(sample_html_spam.get_content())[:1000], "...")

Great! Now let's write a function that takes an email as input and returns its content as plain text, whatever its format is:

def email_to_text(email):
    html = None
    for part in email.walk():
        ctype = part.get_content_type()
        if not ctype in ("text/plain", "text/html"):
            continue
        try:
            content = part.get_content()
        except: # in case of encoding issues
            content = str(part.get_payload())
        if ctype == "text/plain":
            return content
        else:
            html = content
    if html:
        return html_to_plain_text(html)

print(email_to_text(sample_html_spam)[:100], "...")

Let's throw in some stemming! For this to work, you need to install the Natural Language Toolkit ([NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/)). It's as simple as running the following command (don't forget to activate your virtualenv first; if you don't have one, you will likely need administrator rights, or use the `--user` option):

`$ pip3 install nltk`

try:
    import nltk

    stemmer = nltk.PorterStemmer()
    for word in ("Computations", "Computation", "Computing", "Computed", "Compute", "Compulsive"):
        print(word, "=>", stemmer.stem(word))
except ImportError:
    print("Error: stemming requires the NLTK module.")
    stemmer = None

We will also need a way to replace URLs with the word "URL". For this, we could use hard core [regular expressions](https://mathiasbynens.be/demo/url-regex) but we will just use the [urlextract](https://github.com/lipoja/URLExtract) library. You can install it with the following command (don't forget to activate your virtualenv first; if you don't have one, you will likely need administrator rights, or use the `--user` option):

`$ pip3 install urlextract`

# if running this notebook on Colab, we just pip install urlextract
try:
    import google.colab
    !pip install -q -U urlextract
except ImportError:
    pass # not running on Colab

try:
    import urlextract # may require an Internet connection to download root domain names
    
    url_extractor = urlextract.URLExtract()
    print(url_extractor.find_urls("Will it detect github.com and https://youtu.be/7Pq-S557XQU?t=3m32s"))
except ImportError:
    print("Error: replacing URLs requires the urlextract module.")
    url_extractor = None

We are ready to put all this together into a transformer that we will use to convert emails to word counters. Note that we split sentences into words using Python's `split()` method, which uses whitespaces for word boundaries. This works for many written languages, but not all. For example, Chinese and Japanese scripts generally don't use spaces between words, and Vietnamese often uses spaces even between syllables. It's okay in this exercise, because the dataset is (mostly) in English.

from sklearn.base import BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin

class EmailToWordCounterTransformer(BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin):
    def __init__(self, strip_headers=True, lower_case=True, remove_punctuation=True,
                 replace_urls=True, replace_numbers=True, stemming=True):
        self.strip_headers = strip_headers
        self.lower_case = lower_case
        self.remove_punctuation = remove_punctuation
        self.replace_urls = replace_urls
        self.replace_numbers = replace_numbers
        self.stemming = stemming
    def fit(self, X, y=None):
        return self
    def transform(self, X, y=None):
        X_transformed = []
        for email in X:
            text = email_to_text(email) or ""
            if self.lower_case:
                text = text.lower()
            if self.replace_urls and url_extractor is not None:
                urls = list(set(url_extractor.find_urls(text)))
                urls.sort(key=lambda url: len(url), reverse=True)
                for url in urls:
                    text = text.replace(url, " URL ")
            if self.replace_numbers:
                text = re.sub(r'\d+(?:\.\d*)?(?:[eE][+-]?\d+)?', 'NUMBER', text)
            if self.remove_punctuation:
                text = re.sub(r'\W+', ' ', text, flags=re.M)
            word_counts = Counter(text.split())
            if self.stemming and stemmer is not None:
                stemmed_word_counts = Counter()
                for word, count in word_counts.items():
                    stemmed_word = stemmer.stem(word)
                    stemmed_word_counts[stemmed_word] += count
                word_counts = stemmed_word_counts
            X_transformed.append(word_counts)
        return np.array(X_transformed)

Let's try this transformer on a few emails:

X_few = X_train[:3]
X_few_wordcounts = EmailToWordCounterTransformer().fit_transform(X_few)
X_few_wordcounts

This looks about right!

Now we have the word counts, and we need to convert them to vectors. For this, we will build another transformer whose `fit()` method will build the vocabulary (an ordered list of the most common words) and whose `transform()` method will use the vocabulary to convert word counts to vectors. The output is a sparse matrix.

from scipy.sparse import csr_matrix

class WordCounterToVectorTransformer(BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin):
    def __init__(self, vocabulary_size=1000):
        self.vocabulary_size = vocabulary_size
    def fit(self, X, y=None):
        total_count = Counter()
        for word_count in X:
            for word, count in word_count.items():
                total_count[word] += min(count, 10)
        most_common = total_count.most_common()[:self.vocabulary_size]
        self.vocabulary_ = {word: index + 1 for index, (word, count) in enumerate(most_common)}
        return self
    def transform(self, X, y=None):
        rows = []
        cols = []
        data = []
        for row, word_count in enumerate(X):
            for word, count in word_count.items():
                rows.append(row)
                cols.append(self.vocabulary_.get(word, 0))
                data.append(count)
        return csr_matrix((data, (rows, cols)), shape=(len(X), self.vocabulary_size + 1))

vocab_transformer = WordCounterToVectorTransformer(vocabulary_size=10)
X_few_vectors = vocab_transformer.fit_transform(X_few_wordcounts)
X_few_vectors

X_few_vectors.toarray()

What does this matrix mean? Well, the 99 in the second row, first column, means that the second email contains 99 words that are not part of the vocabulary. The 11 next to it means that the first word in the vocabulary is present 11 times in this email. The 9 next to it means that the second word is present 9 times, and so on. You can look at the vocabulary to know which words we are talking about. The first word is "the", the second word is "of", etc.

vocab_transformer.vocabulary_

We are now ready to train our first spam classifier! Let's transform the whole dataset:

from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline

preprocess_pipeline = Pipeline([
    ("email_to_wordcount", EmailToWordCounterTransformer()),
    ("wordcount_to_vector", WordCounterToVectorTransformer()),
])

X_train_transformed = preprocess_pipeline.fit_transform(X_train)

**Note**: to be future-proof, we set `solver="lbfgs"` since this will be the default value in Scikit-Learn 0.22.

from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score

log_clf = LogisticRegression(solver="lbfgs", max_iter=1000, random_state=42)
score = cross_val_score(log_clf, X_train_transformed, y_train, cv=3, verbose=3)
score.mean()

Over 98.5%, not bad for a first try! :) However, remember that we are using the "easy" dataset. You can try with the harder datasets, the results won't be so amazing. You would have to try multiple models, select the best ones and fine-tune them using cross-validation, and so on.

But you get the picture, so let's stop now, and just print out the precision/recall we get on the test set:

from sklearn.metrics import precision_score, recall_score

X_test_transformed = preprocess_pipeline.transform(X_test)

log_clf = LogisticRegression(solver="lbfgs", max_iter=1000, random_state=42)
log_clf.fit(X_train_transformed, y_train)

y_pred = log_clf.predict(X_test_transformed)

print("Precision: {:.2f}%".format(100 * precision_score(y_test, y_pred)))
print("Recall: {:.2f}%".format(100 * recall_score(y_test, y_pred)))
